# Git Module

This module provides agents, skills, and commands for git workflows and troubleshooting.

## When to Use

- **Routine git operations**: Load the `git-cheatsheet` skill for command syntax
- **Committing changes**: Use `/quick-commit` to auto-generate conventional commit messages
- **PR reviews**: Use `/review-pr <number>` for structured code review with test coverage analysis
- **Git problems**: Delegate to `git-doctor` for diagnosing issues like detached HEAD, lost commits, merge conflicts, or corrupted repos
