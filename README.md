# Lola - AI Skills Package Manager

**Write your AI context once, use it everywhere.**

Every AI tool wants its own prompt format. Claude Code uses `SKILL.md`. Cursor uses `.mdc` rules. Gemini CLI uses `GEMINI.md`. Slash commands? Different syntax for each. You end up maintaining the same instructions in three different places—or worse, giving up and only using one tool.

Lola fixes this. Write your skills and commands once as portable modules, then install them everywhere with a single command.

## Installation

```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola

# Or clone and install locally
git clone https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola
cd lola
uv tool install .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Add a module

```bash
# From a git repository
lola mod add https://github.com/user/my-skills.git

# From a local folder
lola mod add ./my-local-skills

# From a zip or tar file
lola mod add ~/Downloads/skills.zip

# From a monorepo with custom content directory
lola mod add https://github.com/company/monorepo.git --module-content=packages/lola-skills

# From a flat repository (use root directory)
lola mod add https://github.com/user/flat-repo.git --module-content=/
```

### 2. Install skills to your AI assistants

```bash
# Install to all assistants in the current directory
lola install my-skills

# Install to a specific assistant in the current directory
lola install my-skills -a claude-code

# Install to a specific project directory
lola install my-skills ./my-project
```

### 3. List and manage

```bash
# List modules in registry
lola mod ls

# List installed modules
lola installed

# Update module from source
lola mod update my-skills

# Regenerate assistant files after changes
lola update
```

## Using Marketplaces

Marketplaces let you discover and install modules from curated catalogs without manually finding repository URLs.

### Official Lola Marketplace

We maintain an official, community-driven marketplace with curated modules at [github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market).

**Quick setup:**
```bash
lola market add general https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market/main/general-market.yml
```

This gives you instant access to community modules like workflow automation, code quality tools, and more. **We highly encourage you to:**
- Use modules from the official marketplace
- Contribute your own modules
- Share feedback and improvements

All contributions are welcome! See the [marketplace contributing guide](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Register a marketplace

```bash
# Add a marketplace from a URL
lola market add general https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatProductSecurity/lola-market/main/general-market.yml

# List registered marketplaces
lola market ls
```

### Search and install from marketplace

```bash
# Search across all enabled marketplaces
lola mod search authentication

# Install directly from marketplace (auto-adds and installs)
lola install git-workflow -a claude-code
```

When a module exists in multiple marketplaces, Lola prompts you to select which one to use.

### Manage marketplaces

```bash
# Update marketplace cache
lola market update general

# Update all marketplaces
lola market update

# Disable a marketplace (keeps it registered but excludes from search)
lola market set --disable general

# Re-enable a marketplace
lola market set --enable general

# Remove a marketplace
lola market rm general
```

### Marketplace YAML format

Create your own marketplace by hosting a YAML file with this structure:

```yaml

## Creating a Module

### 1. Initialize

```bash
lola mod init my-skills
cd my-skills
```

This creates:

```
my-skills/
  skills/
    example-skill/
      SKILL.md         # Initial skill (unless --no-skill)
  commands/            # Created by default
    example-command.md # (unless --no-command)
  agents/              # Created by default
    example-agent.md   # (unless --no-agent)
```

### 2. Edit the skill

Edit `skills/example-skill/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skills
description: Description shown in skill listings
---

# My Skill

Instructions for the AI assistant...
```

### 3. Add supporting files to skills

You can add additional files to any skill directory (scripts, templates, examples, etc.). Reference them using relative paths in your `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
# My Skill

Use the helper script: `./scripts/helper.sh`

Load the template from: `./templates/example.md`
```

**Path handling:** Use relative paths like `./file` or `./scripts/helper.sh` to reference files in the same skill directory. Each assistant handles these differently:

| Assistant | Skill Location | Supporting Files | Path Behavior |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` | Copied with skill | Paths work as-is |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/<skill>.mdc` | Stay in `.lola/modules/` | Paths rewritten automatically |
| Gemini | `GEMINI.md` (references only) | Stay in `.lola/modules/` | Paths work (SKILL.md read from source) |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` (references only) | Stay in `.lola/modules/` | Paths work (SKILL.md read from source) |

- **Claude Code** copies the entire skill directory, so relative paths like `./scripts/helper.sh` work because the files are alongside `SKILL.md`
- **Cursor** only copies the skill content to an `.mdc` file, so Lola rewrites `./` paths to point back to `.lola/modules/<module>/skills/<skill>/`
- **Gemini/OpenCode** don't copy skills—they add entries to `GEMINI.md`/`AGENTS.md` that tell the AI to read the original `SKILL.md` from `.lola/modules/`, so relative paths work from that location

Example skill structure:

```
my-skills/
  skills/
    example-skill/
      SKILL.md
      scripts/
        helper.sh
      templates/
        example.md
```

### 4. Add more skills

Create additional skill directories under `skills/`, each with a `SKILL.md`:

```
my-skills/
  skills/
    example-skill/
      SKILL.md
    git-workflow/
      SKILL.md
    code-review/
      SKILL.md
```

### 4. Add slash commands

Create a `commands/` directory with markdown files:

```
my-skills/
  skills/
    example-skill/
      SKILL.md
  commands/
    review-pr.md
    quick-commit.md
```

Command files use YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
description: Review a pull request
argument-hint: <pr-number>
---

Review PR #$ARGUMENTS and provide feedback.
```

> **Note:** Modules use auto-discovery. Skills, commands, and agents are automatically detected from the directory structure. No manifest file is required.

### 5. Add to registry and install

```bash
lola mod add ./my-skills
lola install my-skills
```

## Module Structure

LOLA supports three module patterns:

1. **Single Skill** - Entire repository is one skill ([agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) standard)
2. **Skill Bundle** - Multiple skills packaged together
3. **AI Context Module** - Full-featured module with instructions, skills, commands, and agents (recommended)

**Quick examples:**

```bash
# Single skill
my-skill/
  SKILL.md

# Skill bundle
my-bundle/
  skills/
    skill-a/SKILL.md
    skill-b/SKILL.md

# AI Context Module (recommended for complete modules)
my-module/
  module/
    AGENTS.md       # Module-level instructions
    skills/
      skill-a/SKILL.md
    commands/
      cmd.md
```

See [detailed structure guide](#detailed-module-structure) below for when to use each pattern and full examples.

### SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to use this skill
---

# Skill Title

Your instructions, workflows, and guidance for the AI assistant.

Reference supporting files using relative paths:
- `./scripts/helper.sh` - files in the same skill directory
- `./templates/example.md` - subdirectories are supported
```

**Supporting files:** You can include scripts, templates, examples, or any other files in your skill directory. Use relative paths like `./file` or `./scripts/helper.sh` in your `SKILL.md` to reference them. These paths are automatically rewritten for different assistant types during installation.

### Command Files

```markdown
---
description: What this command does
argument-hint: <required> [optional]
---

Your prompt template here. Use $ARGUMENTS for all args or $1, $2 for positional.
```

**Argument variables:**
- `$ARGUMENTS` - All arguments as a single string
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3`... - Positional arguments

Commands are automatically converted to each assistant's format:
- Claude/Cursor: Markdown with frontmatter (pass-through)
- Gemini: TOML with `{{args}}` substitution

## Detailed Module Structure

### Pattern 1: Single Skill

Entire repository is one focused skill. Follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) standard.

```
my-skill/
  SKILL.md           # Required
  scripts/           # Optional: supporting files
  references/        # Optional: documentation
```

**When to use:** Creating a standalone, focused skill to share or reuse across projects.

### Pattern 2: Skill Bundle

Package multiple related skills together without module-level instructions.

```
my-bundle/
  skills/
    skill-a/
      SKILL.md       # Required
      scripts/       # Optional
    skill-b/
      SKILL.md
```

**When to use:** Grouping related skills for easier distribution (e.g., [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills)).

### Pattern 3: AI Context Module (Recommended)

Complete module with module-level instructions, skills, commands, and agents.

```
my-module/
  module/            # Content directory
    AGENTS.md        # Module-level instructions/context
    skills/
      skill-a/
        SKILL.md
        scripts/
    commands/
      review.md
    agents/
      helper.md
```

**When to use:** Building a comprehensive AI context module for your project or team. The `AGENTS.md` provides module-level instructions that apply across all skills, commands, and agents.

### Content Path Detection

LOLA automatically detects where module content lives:

**Auto-detection** (default): Checks for `module/` subdirectory, then falls back to repository root.

**Custom path** (CLI):
```bash
lola mod add https://github.com/company/monorepo.git --module-content=packages/ai-tools
```

**Custom path** (Marketplace):
```yaml
modules:
  - name: custom-module
    repository: https://github.com/company/monorepo.git
    path: packages/ai-tools  # Where to find module content
```

> **Tip:** If you're unsure which structure to use, run `lola mod init` to create a new module with the recommended structure.

## How It Works

1. **Marketplaces**: Register catalogs at `~/.lola/market/` with cached data at `~/.lola/market/cache/`
2. **Discovery**: Search across enabled marketplace caches to find modules
3. **Registry**: Modules are stored in `~/.lola/modules/`
4. **Installation**: Skills and commands are converted to each assistant's native format
5. **Prefixing**: Skills and commands are prefixed with module name to avoid conflicts (e.g., `mymodule-skill`)
6. **Project scope**: Copies modules to `.lola/modules/` within the project
7. **Updates**: `lola mod update` re-fetches from original source; `lola update` regenerates files; `lola market update` refreshes marketplace caches
